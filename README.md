# Tello-Recon ðŸŽ¯
Project for COMP-361: A drone recon automation system built for the DJU Tello Drone

### Warning
This software is provided "as is"- use this software at your own risk. 
Drones can be dangerous so be sure to test from a safe disatance and with safety precautions in place. 

## Project Goals
**This is the term project for COMP-361** 
The goal of this project is to create an automated drone "recon" system that can survey and record a given area on a regular basis.

This has a number of practical applications: 
1. **Automated property security** : the tello has a large enough range that it's practical to use it as a
2. **Site surveying for progress** : construction contractor's could use this to take visual snapshots of progress over time. 
3. TBD
